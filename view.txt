I think the people of Springfield, need to start removing old corpses from the city's cemetery. That were burying no later than 1945. Because they are starting to run out of space, it takes too much to maintain the old graveyards, and they are now a hindrance on the local taxpayer's money.

The main city's cemetery, is almost in at 80% capacity. Since there is a high amount of elderly people in the city, there is a high level of mortality. In order to solve this space issue, the city has been burying the deceased people outside the city. This action upsets the locals of Springfield. As result, the city's main cemetery is out of space.

The city has a lack of natural green graveyard spaces, so the mayor wants to implement a new type of cemetery. The mayor is following a recent trend from Europe that creates natural green graveyard spaces. A natural green graveyard is like a park that utilize the ashes of the corpses to fertilize new young sapiens. The mayor along with the people of Spring should agree to make more natural green graveyard spaces.

In some cases, the cost of maintain old graveyards are too expensive. There are several graveyards that belongs to WWII heroes, which the city has to maintain, daily. The Springfield citizens are tired of supporting these old graveyards with their taxes. In conclusion, the cost of maintaining old graveyards are out of the Springfield's budget.

To sum it up, the people of Springfield need to excavate al bodies bury before 1945.Â  The main cemetery only has 20% availability left over for any future burial space. The major has decided to give new natural green graveyard space an upgraded burial space.The citizens of Springfield cannot afford the cost of maintaining old burial plot.
