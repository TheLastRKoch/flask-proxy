I believe that the residents of Springfield should consider removing the old corpses from the city's cemetery. These individuals were buried no later than 1945. The old graveyards are running out of space, and it is becoming increasingly expensive to maintain them. This is becoming a burden on the local taxpayers.

The main city cemetery is nearly 80% full. Due to the high number of elderly residents, there is a significant mortality rate. To address the space issue, the city has been burying the deceased outside the city, which has caused dissatisfaction among Springfield locals. As a result, the main cemetery is now at full capacity.

The city lacks natural green spaces for burial, so the mayor wants to introduce a new type of cemetery. The mayor is following a recent trend from Europe that involves creating natural green graveyard spaces. A natural green graveyard is like a park that uses the ashes of the deceased to fertilize new plant life. The mayor and the people of Spring should consider creating more natural green graveyard spaces.

Maintaining old graveyards can be too expensive in some cases. The city is responsible for the upkeep of several graveyards belonging to WWII heroes, which requires daily maintenance. The citizens of Springfield are becoming weary of funding the maintenance of these old graveyards through their taxes. In summary, the cost of maintaining old graveyards exceeds Springfield's budget

To summarize, the residents of Springfield need to excavate all bodies buried before 1945. The main cemetery has only 20% of its space available for future burials. The mayor has decided to create a new natural green graveyard with upgraded burial space. The citizens of Springfield cannot afford the cost of maintaining the old burial plot.
